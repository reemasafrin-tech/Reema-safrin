I am a first-year college student currently working as a Data Analyst Intern at ElevateLabs 📊, where I gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets and analytical workflows. My work involves collecting datasets from platforms like Kaggle 📁, cleaning and transforming raw CSV data into structured formats, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Microsoft Excel and Python 🐍. I have created data visualizations and dashboards to highlight trends, patterns, and insights, including analysis of streaming platform content. Alongside data analytics, I have foundational knowledge of Artificial Intelligence 🤖, supported by relevant coursework and internships. I am highly motivated to strengthen my analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and data-driven decision-making through continuous learning and practical experience 🚀.
